# eAIP-rs

## Overview

eAIP is a library that provides utilities, and abstracts access to electronic Aeronautical
Information Packages (eAIPs). It includes a lot of functions to collect navigational data into
convenient types, and for sections which have fewer pre-written tools (for example, operational data
regarding aerodromes), tools are provided to fetch the pages from each Aeronautical Information Service
(AIS) for processing yourself.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

Although data provided by this library is sourced from real-world sources, this data is not suitable for
use in real-world flight, particularly as errors in this library could cause corruption of vital data.

**Do not use for real world flight.**
