# eAIP-rs

## Overview

eAIP is a library that provides utilities, and abstracts access to electronic Aeronautical
Information Packages (eAIPs). It includes a lot of functions to collect navigational data into
convenient types, and for sections which have fewer pre-written tools (for example, operational data
regarding aerodromes), tools are provided to fetch the pages from each Aeronautical Information Service
(AIS) for processing yourself.
